# TGSA
TGSA: Protein-Protein Association-Based Twin Graph Neural Networks for Drug Response Prediction with Similarity Augmentation

# Overview
Here we provide an implementation of Twin Graph neural networks with Similarity Augmentation (TGSA) IN Pytorch and PyTorch Geometric. The repository is organised as follows:

- data/ contains the necessary dataset files;
- models/ contains the implementation of TGDRP and SA;
- weights contains the trained weights;
- utils/ contains the necessary processing subroutines;
- preprocess_gene.py preprocessing for genetic profiles;
- smiles2graph.py construct molecular graphs based on SMILES;
- main.py main function for TGDRP (train or test);
- main_SA.py main function for SA (train or test);

Coming soon!
